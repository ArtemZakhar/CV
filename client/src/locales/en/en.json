  "COVER": "Discipline, attention to detail, a sense of the process, the extreme need to do everything correctly and immediately change processes in case of errors, absence of an expression 'I don't know' in the vocabulary - these are some of my characteristics I have developed working as a logistics specialist and which I believe are useful in a new role I chose. In the process of learning JS, I realized quite quickly that it`s not simple and there is a space to get dipper. I feel a constant interest in extending my knowledge, and therefore I hope to gain practical experience in a short period of time in order to become a strong developer.",
